# Flocking
An Java application built for my Computer Physics class that simulate flocking behavior in real time, based on this article: https://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/
# What I Learned
- Using OOP to reuse already existing code into new objects
- Creating Swing application
- Drawing multiple moving objects on JPanel and updating their positions based on simple physics formulas
- Handling mouseEvent
- Listening for user changes and applaying them in simulation
